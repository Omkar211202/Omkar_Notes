## Ratio Analysis:
### Liquidity Ratio:

- $Current\hspace{2mm}Ratio$ = $\dfrac{current\hspace{2mm}assets}{current\hspace{2mm}liabilites}$


- $Quick\hspace{2mm}Ratio$ = $\dfrac{quick\hspace{2mm}assets}{quick\hspace{2mm}liabilites}$



- $Absolute\hspace{2mm}Cash\hspace{2mm}Ratio$ = $\dfrac{cash+marketable\hspace{2mm}securities}{current\hspace{2mm}liabilites}$



- $Interval\hspace{2mm}Measure$ = $\dfrac{quick\hspace{2mm}assets}{current\hspace{2mm}expenses\hspace{2mm}per\hspace{2mm}day}$



- quick assets = CA - prepaid expenses - inventories.


- quick liabilities = CL - bank OD - cash credit

---
###  Capital Structure Ratios:

- $Debt\hspace{2mm}Equity\hspace{2mm}Ratio$ = $\dfrac{debt}{equity}$


- $Equity\hspace{2mm}to\hspace{2mm}Total\hspace{2mm}funds\hspace{2mm}Ratios$= $\dfrac{equity}{total funds}$


- $Capital\hspace{2mm}Gearing\hspace{2mm}Ratio$ = $\dfrac{fixed\hspace{2mm}charge\hspace{2mm}bearing\hspace{2mm}capital}{equity\hspace{2mm}shareholder\hspace{2mm}funds}$


---
### Limitation of Ratio Analysis:
- diversified product lines
- window dressing could lead to false representations
- inflation is not accounted for in the calculations
- no standards against comparison
- differences in accounting policies and accounting period.
- financial ratio are inter-related, not independent.
- qualitative
- inter industry comparison is not feasible
- seasonal factors

---
### Budget and decisional making
- finding deviations
- revision of plans
- implementation of standard costing
- credit rating
- cost consciousness
- efficiency and effective utilization of resources
- control and expenditure

---
### Activity based accounting and Traditional
- based on cost pools , based on cost centers
- realistic, not realistic
- elimination of irrelevant act, not elimination
- cost are levied on objects, assigned to cost units
- activity wise cost drivers are determined, time are assumed to be the only cost driver governing costs in all department.

## Activity Based Costing

### Traditional system and drawbacks:
In the traditional format of costing, the overhead costs were allotted to production centers and they were ascertained to be a proportion of heads like machine hours or labor hrs. etc.

### Limitations of TCS:
1. indirect costs are proportioned to volume, which may not be always true.
2. Proportioning may lead to cost distortion, where tasks are complex in nature.(Under costing in low volume production and over costing in high volume production )
3. Both large volume and low volume products will be allocated proportions based on volume, where as low vol prod. may occupy more cost

### Activity Based Costing(ABC):
- costs are allocated based on activities in the process  and production heads or cost centers.
- grouped based on Cost Drivers, activities significant towards cost.
- sub-activities will be pooled under a head, that becomes the cost driver.

### Cost Allocation:
- There are two systems:
1. Tracing costs to activities
2. Tracing cost from activities to products.

- selecting cost drivers: Very crucial in the process, choosing them is based on discretion. Choosing a lot of activities may provide accuracy in measurement, but its cumbersome. So activities  that are too detrimental to the production must be chosen.

- Types of Activity Drivers:
1. Transaction: These use the same resources every time.
2. Duration: time consumed in the process is measured as a driver. Eg: direct lab hrs.
3. Intensity: special operations where work is based on quality and intensity deserve different activity subheadings.

### Activity based Management:
ABM seeks to better the process of managing activities based on the info from ABC system.

Helps in:
1. Repricing of Unprofitable products.
2. Increase in Sales Volumes.
3. Process Improvement.
4. Engineering and Design Improvements.

Cost of Resource capacity:
1. Practical Capacity:
2. Unused capacity:

### Advantages:

- will not over cost a high vol prod. and under cost a low vol prod.
- improved cost control.

### Disadvantages:
- expensive affair to monitor and make cost drivers.

## Budgeting
### Purpose:
- comprehensive and coordinated plan.
- Operations and Resources.
- Financial Terms.
- Specific Future Period
- Comprehensiveness

1. Explicit statement of expectations.
2. Communication
3. Coordination
4. Expectations as a Framework for judging performance.

Operating Budgets:
1. sales budget.
2. production budget
3. purchase budget
4. direct labor budget.
5. manufacturing expenses budget
6. administrative and selling expenses budget and so on.

Finance budgets:
1. cash budget
2. budget income statement.
3. budgeted statement of retained earnings.
4. budgeted balance sheet

### Flexible Budgets: based on level of activity.
- flexible/ variable/ sliding budgets.

## Cost Volume Profit:

Formulas:

$contribution = sales - variable cost = Fixed cost + profits.$

$contribution\hspace{2mm}margin = sales\hspace{2mm}per\hspace{2mm}unit-var\hspace{2mm}per\hspace{2mm}unit$

$contribution\hspace{2mm}margin\hspace{2mm}ratio=\dfrac{contribution\hspace{2mm}margin\hspace{2mm}per\hspace{2mm}unit}{sp\hspace{2mm}per\hspace{2mm}unit}$

$BreakEven(units)=\dfrac{total\hspace{2mm}fixed\hspace{2mm}cost}{contribution\hspace{2mm}per\hspace{2mm}unit}$

$BreakEven(sales)=\dfrac{total\hspace{2mm}fixed\hspace{2mm}cost}{cmr/PE ratio}$



$Margin\hspace{2mm}of\hspace{2mm}Safety= actual\hspace{2mm}sales-breakeven\hspace{2mm}sales$

$Margin\hspace{2mm}of\hspace{2mm}safety\hspace{2mm}ratio=\dfrac{margin\hspace{2mm}of\hspace{2mm}safety}{actual\hspace{2mm}sales}*100$


$Profit$= margin of safety * Pv ratio.
