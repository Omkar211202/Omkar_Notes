## What's BGS ??

BGS is the study of interactions btw :
1. Business - Manufacturing, service and management.
2. Government - Rules and policies.
3. Society- cooperative network of human relations.


### Models of BGS.
1. Market capitalism model:
   - In this model, business  is affected by market forces alone.
   - Govt involvement into the business is minimal.
   - Business is meant to satiate the needs of owners and investors.
   - The sole measure of performance is profit.

2. Dominance model:
- In this model, only a few elite and corporations can influence the business environment in a country, this will in turn affect the masses.
- Undemocratic method.

3. Countervailing Forces model:
- Business is affected by the open society and cannot exert undue influence on them. No part of society is isolated from the business.
- Also called the democratic model.

4. Stakeholder Model:
- Under this model, the business breaks the traditional definition of "Stakeholders", its purview reaches out other entities that may be affected by its activities.
- There are a set of entities called secondary stakeholders, who also play a pivotal role for business in decision making.

### Importance of BGS to managers:

1. Social contract.
2. adapting to changing expectations.
3. balancing economical and social expectations.
4. understand non-market forces.

### Array Forests Case study:
Brief:
Array is the green lung of Mumbai providing substantial oxygen to the robust and overpopulous city of Mumbai.
The govt. is planning to use 33 hectares of land for the construction of the metro shed for the upcoming Mumbai underground Metro.

There is lots of protests by environmentalists, Adivasis and others, including the opposition govt. (congress and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray)) .

Concerns:
Against using Array:
1. Adivasis fear loss of land due to further occupancy for development, once the metro shed comes up.
2. Loss of green cover in a city with lots of population and pollution like Bombay.
3. Loss of few endangered species that live in Mumbai.
4. Displacement of Adivasis due to project.
5. Eco-sensitive zone.

Cases for using Array:
1. Just the use of 33 hectares of the vast forest.
2. Faster work progress and strategic location for the project.
3. Urban planners will not loose property at the alternative suggested, Kanchamarg.


### Political Wars & other issues:
1. Fadnavis directed the forest dept. for objection of eco-sensitive zone.
2. Requirement  is 80 acres but using 400 acres.
3. Commercial activities in the list that will roll out later.
4. While Fadnavis is pro for shed at array, the opposition wants Kanchamarg.
5. Metro will reduce $CO_2$

### Alternatives:
1. Use of Array since the area is minimal.
2. Kanchamarg could be used instead of array.

### Fourteen principles of  ethics:
code:C2D2IMEGOPRPT
- categorical imperative: do that thing that is considered good by all people in the world.
- conventional ethic: follow the social norms, traditions accepted by the masses.
- disclosure: relevant information should be openly shared and can be easily done.
- doctrine of the mean: no excess and deficiency.
- ends means ethic: if end result is good means the "Means" is justified.
- golden rule: Do onto others what you expect from them.
- intuition ethic: inherent sense of discretion and discrimination.
- might equals right ethic: responsible for the work you have done.
- organization ethic: must not disobey the foundations of the organization.
- principle of equal freedom: maximum freedom provided it does not infringe on the equal freedom of others.
- proportionality ethic: actions should not cause harm more than the benefit.
- rights ethic: Each and everyone's right is upheld in the process.
- theory of justice:  fairness and equality,
- utilitarian: maximizes overall happiness or utility for the greatest number of people.

### Ratan Tata:
1. No metrics to measure for employee well being, customer happiness , vendors etc.
2. Only profit is seen for company performance.

[[BGS-Models.excalidraw]]


1. The Carrol's pyramid model tells us that the business will move up the pyramid, once the foundational goals are satisfied. First profits, then compliance, ethics and lastly charity. 
2. Intersecting circles: All go hand in hand simultaneously.
3. The Concentric circles model says that though the economic is the core, the others play more significant role in building the image of the business.
