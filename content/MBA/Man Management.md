## Man Management.

## Chapter 1:

### Educare is true Education.

1. Why do we study?  Primarily the core need of education is to earn a living. So we study to get money to survive. Well, lets question ourselves, if mere living is the purpose of education, even animals and birds live without education. So what exactly is the need for education??Well, Education is for life, not for living. So, one possible reason to learn things is to enhance your life, and not be satisfied by mere living. In the scope of earning a living, education becomes so niche, that people often to gain the general knowledge about how things work. Well, even on job, there will be a huge difference between what is taught and what you do. So all you learn in the classroom, practically dies after exams. The only thing that lies with each one of us, is the practical knowledge. Thus, only the knowledge we keep to practice survives, RIP bookish knowledge.

2. What is the difference between a College and Gurukula? At college, people learn only in the classrooms, but at a Gurukula, learning is the way of life, its beyond classroom. In the yore, Sages took all the disciples to all the places they went, making learning a way of life.
3. Educare is nothing but Education with culture (kindness, tolerance & compassion) as ingrained in the Indian ethos.
4. Education is like plain water that becomes sweet with addition of sugar (culture) stirred with the spoon of enquiry making lives sweet.
5. Sa Vidhya Yaa Vimuktaye. True knowledge opens the Realms of the Mind.

### Ideal Manager.

The professional degree in management is called MBA (Master of Business Administration). Before becoming a master, one has to be a manager. Typically, the toughest thing to manage is not finances, but people.
Hence, we got to learn to manage ourselves and men around us, making it "MAN MANAGEMENT".

Business is the process of being busy or doing some work. So, everyone is doing business since birth till death, in the process obtaining joys and sorrows.

The 7 facets of a manager are as follows:
- Mind of Man: 
must have the qualities of love, patience, sacrifice and compassion to succeed in life.
- Awareness of ATMA:
awareness is complete awareness. Atman is made of the five elements(NARAS): sky, wind, fire, water and Prithvi.
- Nature of Nations: each country has its own nature. nature of Bharat to speak the truth and abide by dharma.
- Aspects of environment: aware of political, physical, spiritual and mental dimensions.
- Enquiry into Ethos: Itihasa (history ) is the source of inspiration for each of us. E.g.: Chhatrapati Shivaji, ramadas etc.
- Guidelines to goodness: swa+bhav is always right. follow the conscience
- Role of Rules: quality is primary in all the things we do.
