## Operations Management:

- Operations management deals with: Process design and management - product service dev - supply chain management.


> [!IMPORTANT] Definition of Operations
> Design, management and improvement of systems that create and deliver products and services to the customer.

- Design: designing systems.
- manage: smooth execution.
- improve: continuous improvement to enhance productivity, quality and customer satisfaction. (PQC)

Core Areas of Operations:
Product and service design:
- refers to the planning of goods that meet customer needs while ensuring cost-efficiency, manufacturability and scalability.
- involves defining intangible services in a way that ensures customer satisfaction.
 
process design:
- involves workflow, equipment and layout needed to produce goods and services.

Supply chain management: encompasses the management of all the activities involved in producing and delivering a product, from the sourcing of raw materials to final delivery to customers.

Inventory management:
ensuring sufficient levels of stock to meet the demand without overstocking, which can increase costs.

Capacity planning: determining the production capacity needed to meet the customer demand.

Quality management: ensuring that the products meet customer expectations or exceeding the  same, giving customers high level of satisfaction.

Scheduling:
Ensuring right amount of resources are available at the right time to meet production goals.

> [!NOTE] Recap and final Definition
> Systematic approach to address issues in the transformation  process that converts inputs into useful, revenue generating outputs.

Systems Theory:
- a systems perspective facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of OM.
- essentially involves identifying the input, the output, the processing and feedback mechanisms in a system.

Operations as service:
- focus on intangible outputs like customer satisfaction and service delivery efficiency.

> [!IMPORTANT] Definition of Service
> activity or benefit that one party can offer another party that is intangible and does not result in ownership of anything.

- characteristics of service: customer participation, simultaneous , perishable, intangibility and heterogeneity. (CSPIH)

Operations management functions:
- Design vs operational control issue.

- Ensuring that all operational activities align with the strategic goals of the organization.
- Eg: Zara

Productivity Measurement:
- efficiency is measured by converting inputs to outputs.
- quantified through metrics that vary by industry.
- Eg: Mc Donald's

Strategy formulation: 
- systematic way to determine how an organization can achieve a competitive advantage and align its operations with corporate strategies.

Process:
- understanding competitive dynamics in the market place: identify market trends, competitors, key differentiators.
- identifying order order winning  (affordability, customization, convenience) (differentiate the brand and influence purchase decisions) and order qualifying attributes (quality, accessibility, ambiance) (basic requirements to compete in the market)
- deciding on strategic options for sustaining competitive advantage.(differentiation, cost leadership, focus strategy)
- matching strategic options with overall corporate strategy.(mission alignment, resource allocation, growth focus)
- develop operations strategy.(process, product, location, customer experience)

## Quality Management:

- Gurus: Willian Edward Deming: PDCA: plan do check act
- increase quality - cost  decrease - productivity increase - market share increases - stay in business and provide more jobs.
- Juran's Trilology (Planning, control, improvement).
- proposed Zero defects - do it right the first time. (Philip B Crosby), proposed 4 absolutes.
- Karao Ishikawa: promoted concept of company wide quality, fishbone diagram.
- Shigeo Shingo: Poka Yoke (error proof)
- Genichi Taguchi- 3 stage approach - system design, parameter design and tolerance design.

Fish bone diagram:

[[Fish_diag.excalidraw]]


> [!note] Definition Quality
> Conformance to specifications, meeting customer needs and fitness for use
> 

- 8 dimension of quality: Performance, Features, Reliability, Conformance, Durability, Serviceability, Aesthetics, Safety
(SASRPFCD)


> [!IMPORTANT] Definition of TQM
> Org wide efforts to develop system, tools, techniques, skills and mindset to build a quality assurance system meeting the emerging market needs.

A good TQM Process:
- top management, employee involvement, addressing the training requirements of employees, quality assurance and cont. improvement.

Categories of tools available:
- quality problems (control charts)
- specific improvement opportunities. (histograms, check sheets, pareto diagrams, scatter diagrams, graphs).
- analyzing problem and their root cases. (cause and effect / fishbone diagram, CEDAC) (affinity and relationship mapping).
- tools for operational planning (Tree diagram, matrix, poka-yoke, arrow diagram)
- tools for strategic planning.(Quality function, deployment, quality costing).

Control costs: prevention, appraisal.
- costs required to eliminate any defects during production
- ascertain the cost of defects in a product. (Inspection costs)

Failure costs: Internal and external. (costs of rework in the factory, Replacement, warranty)

Quality function deployment (QFD): (Yoji Akao, 1960's, KOBE shipyards)
- approach that was designed to ensure customer needs were explicitly addressed in product design and development.

Prizes in Quality:
- Deming Prize winner for quality assurance
- Malcolm Baldrige National Quality award (MBNQA)

- House of Quality diagram

Quality is unity in thought, word and deed.

## Production System Design:

1. Product, Process and Production Design 
- Product Design: `form and function of a product.`
- Form design: what a product would look like; the shape, appearance, what it will be made of and how it will be made. (aesthetics, size, volume and weight).
- process design: how the operations are sequentially arranged.
- differentiation by product design, arrangement of elements that collative form a good or service
- functional design: function the product performs and how it performs.
- Production Design: the effort to design for producibility and low manufacturing costs.
- Excellent design: UARFIA : usability, aesthetics, Reliability, functionality, innovation and appropriateness.
- ensure quality, reasonable cost, and expected product features.

> [!Table] Process of product design

## Capacity Planning:


> [!IMPORTANT] Definition of Capacity:
> availability of resources for use by various process.
>  Amount of output a system is capable of achieving over a specific period of time.

- Framework:
1. Estimating capacity requirements.
2. Evaluating alternate methods for augmenting capacity.
3. devising methods to use capacity effectively.

- Planning: huge fixed cost, limits the capability for production, should be related to the intensiveness, how a facility is used. sub-contracting can boost capacity limit.

- Measures: if product is homogenous, capacity units are obvious.(Beer: crates, Water: bottles) When diverse, they can limited resource as a capacity measure.(Airlines: Available seat Miles).

- $Capacity Utilisation Rate=\dfrac{Capacity-used}{best-operating-design}$

Process of Capacity  planning:
-  steps of capacity planning: Predict demand, convert it into required capacity requirements, alternate capacity plans, economic effects of alternate plans, risk and strategic effects, Implementation.

- Economies of scale: Operating leverage, optimum output that minimizes fixed and variable costs.

- Capacity strategy: how it approaches its capital intensive resources, will help it to handle change in customer demand.

- decisions: interface marketing in terms of product strategies and production, engineering: product and process innovation, utilization of fixed resources: Debt equity instruments, and be product focused or process focused.

- long-term cap planning: deals with new facilities and equipment's with a time period, more than two years. (Strategic planning)
- short term capacity: inventory, work-force and overtime budgets.
- understatement can lead to limited growth and loss of customers and overstatement can lead to higher costs and lesser profits.

![[Time_Planning.png]]

- decisions: existing capacity to long term requirements, alternate sources, long term planning is based on stable metrics like population increase, urbanization and industrialization, generally incremental increases in capacity rather than large ones, rely on probability methods, economic analysis of alternatives.

- Handling capacity requirements:
- Case 1: Present capacity is not sufficient: sub contracting, acquire other facilities, build new plants, expand, modernize or modify existing facilities, reactivating facilities which are on stand-by status.

- Excess Capacity: sell off existing facilities, sell inventory, place facilities in stand-by mode, phasing in new products, outsource surplus capacity available.(opposite of case1)

Alternate plans:
- vertical integration, relocation of new plants, effects of capacity  on products and process.

Economies of scale: reduction in average cost of a product due to increase in output itself.
- due to : fixed cost spread over, discounts on material, operating cost do not increase linearly, efficiency in larger scale of production.
- diseconomies: increase in avg cost post a certain threshold: due to: excessive use of machinery, congestion of machinery, slower service times, poor quality, increased use of overtime and the corresponding increase in labor costs, difficulty in coordination and management activities.

MRP: Manufacturing Resource Planning:
- divide and assign specific and detailed tasks that people evaluate, agree upon and are accountable for. 

Line balancing:
arrangement of production line so that there is even flow of production from one work station to another work station, arranged in sequential design to gain high utilization of labor and equipment and minimizing idle time.
- identify tasks, precedence diagram, estimate the task time, estimate cycle time, assign work to each of the worker.
