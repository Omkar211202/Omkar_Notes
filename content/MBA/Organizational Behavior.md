Organizational behavior is defined as the field of study that investigates how individuals, groups and structure influence behavior within organizations in order to improve organizational effectiveness.

### Theories of Organizational Theories:
- Classical Behavior Theories: emphasizes efficiency, productivity, hierarchical structure within organizations.
- Human Relations Theory: significant relationship bw employee satisfaction and motivation. Eg: Hawthorne experiment.
- Contingency Theory and system theory: flexible and adaptive, tailoring strategies to fit specific circumstances and challenges faced by the organization. Systems Theory talks about holistic approach  to management where understanding the relationships and dependencies within the organization is key to achieving overall effectiveness and sustainability.
- Cultural theories: how values, beliefs and norms within an org. influence employee behavior and org. outcomes.

### Interdisciplinary:

- Sociology: Study of people in relation to their social env. or culture.
- Social Psychology: study of how people influence each other by combining concepts and ideas from psychology and sociology
- Anthropology: study of societies to learn about human beings and their activities.

### Challenges in OB:
- Globalization: foreign assigns, working with different cult people,  low labor and outsourcing and danger of terrorism.( write 2 points under each head)
- striking balance bw work life. 
- handling temporariness.(Job temporariness: teams are no more, frequent, rotation, Org Temp: majority expansions, loss making decisions, mergers an acquisitions, downsizing, outsourcing or sub contracting, non critical divisions)
- creating positive env.('Reflected best self')
- managing a diversified workforce: Race, nation, disability, domestic partners and religion, genders, age and urbanization.
- improving ethical behavior.

### Models of OB:

| Basis                  | Autocratic      | Custodial               | Supportive             | Collegial            | System                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Base                   | power           | economic resource       | leadership             | partnership          | Trust                   |
| Managerial orientation | authority       | money                   | support                | Teamwork             | Caring compassion       |
| employee orientation   | obedience       | security and benefit    | job and performance    | responsible behavior | psychological ownership |
| employee psych result  | depends on boss | depends on organization | status and recognition | self discipline      | self motivaion          |
| employee needs met     | subsistent      | security                | partnership            | self actualization   | wide range              |
| performance result     | minimum         | passive cooperation     | awakened drives        | moderate enthusiasm  | passion                 |
| example                | defense         | garment store           | software firm          | social org.          | some corporate firm     |

## Attitude and Job satisfaction:

Evaluative statements or judgements concerning objects, people or events.
- not obvious, have to explore fundamental properties or components.

### Components of Attitudes:
- Cognitive: opinion or belief = evaluation
- Affective: emotional or feeling segment = feeling
- behavioral: intention to behave in a certain way = action

Cognitive Dissonance: mental conflict bw what a person's behaviors and beliefs do not align.
if there are two beliefs that a person that do not align with each other.
hypocrisy:

### Major Job attitudes:
- Job satisfaction: positive feeling about a job, result from an evaluation of its characteristics. 
- Job involvements: measure of degree a person has with his involvement.
- Organizational commitment: Affective, continuance, obligation.
- Perceived organizational support: how much employees believe that org. values them
- Employee engagement: involvement and satisfaction a person has in the work, he or she does.

Job Satisfaction: A pleasurable emotional state resulting from the appraisals of one's job.
- The work itself.
- pay.
- growth and upward mobility.
- supervision.
- co-workers.
- attitude toward work.

Causes of Job satisfaction:
- Need fulfillment
- Discrepancies
- Value attainment
- Equity
- Trait/ genetic components

Job satisfaction leads to higher productivity, lesser absenteeism and turnover.
Can express dissatisfaction by: exit, voiceover, neglect or loyalty.
Psychological and emotional attachment an individual feels to a relationship, organization, goal or occupation.

Values:
- basic convictions that a specific mode of conduct or end state of existence is personally or socially preferable to an opposite or converse mode of conduct or end state of existence.
- Terminal: desired end states: goals a person would like to achieve in their lifetime.
- Instrumental: means to achieve terminal values

Sources of Value Systems:
- early childhood
- determined: gender, religion, social class, political views.
- relatively stable at early childhood.


| Values                    | Principles                                                | Behaviors                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| what are important        | guidelines influencing how we operate and make decisions. | actual behv. we exhibit / have exhibited |
| based on core ideaologies | based on what we value                                    | guided by our principles.                |
| not actionable in itself. | actionable                                                | the action itself                        |
|                           |                                                           |                                          |

## Learning:

- any relatively permanent change in behavior that occurs as a result of experience.
- practical skills, intrapersonal skills, interpersonal skills, cultural awareness.

### Theories of Learning:
- Classical Conditioning: a type of conditioning in which an individual responds to some stimulus that would not ordinarily produce such a response.
- Unconditioned stimulus: naturally and automatically triggers a response
- Unconditioned response: natural and response to the unconditioned stimulus.
- Conditioned stimulus: previously neutral, after encountering them, change in conditioned response.
- Conditioned response: a learned response to the previously neutral stimulus.

### Operant Conditioning/ Instrumental Conditioning/ Skinnerian Conditioning:
- a method of learning that involves rewards and punishments for behavior.
- operant: "active behavior that acts upon in an environment to gen consequences."
- Positive reinforcement: change in behavior as something fav. happened.
- negative reinforcement: removing the stimulus to make something not happen
- positive punishment: punishment by application
- negative punishment: punishment by removal.

### Shaping Behavior:
- reinforcing successive step that moves individual closer to desired response.

### Albert Bandura's Social Learning Theory;
- modeled behavior - innate person - learning environment.
- people learn from looking at others.
- observe ads and copy them.
- criticized because forgets about complexity of our behavior, rejects usefulness of examining and it ignores completely the role of heredity in human behavioral mechanisms, more complex than lab tested animals.


### Behavior Modification:
- Identify critical behaviors.
- develop baseline performance data.
- identify behavioral contingencies or consequences of performance
- develop and apply intervention strategy to strengthen desirable performance.
- evaluate performance improvement.

### Extinction:
for removing unwanted behaviors in employees is called extinction  by with holding reinforcement.

## Perception:
- the process by which stimuli in the external, physical world are translated into internal. mental representations. Eg. Sensation, attention, comprehension.
- observe, screen and organize.
### Distortions:
- errors in perceptual judgement arising in any part of the perceptual process.
- selective perception: observe people selectively and according interpret on their interest, background, experience and attitudes
- halo effects: striking overall impression with observation of single character.
- contrast effects: evaluate person's character by comparing with people above or below him.
- projections: tendency to observe one's own personal attributes to others
- stereotyping: judging people based on to the group he belongs.

### Principles of perceptual organization:
- figure and ground: perceived based on the back ground.
- principle of similarity: greater similarity of the stimuli, greater to group together.
- principle of proximity: proximity or nearness principle of grouping states that are  close together will be perceived as a whole of parts or pattern of parts belonging together.
- principle of continuity: figure that is complete will be grouped together.
- principle of closure: when faced with incomplete info., gaps are filled by own interpretations.

### Social perception:
study of how we form impressions of and make impressions about other people.

### Impression management:
process of acting in a way that represents a desired image.

## Personality:

- The Person & Environment affects the behavior. ($B=f(P,E)$)
- It comes from the Latin word: "Persona", meaning Mask.
- An individual's distinct and relatively enduring pattern of  thoughts, feelings, motives, and behaviors.
- A dynamic organization within each individual of those psychophysical systems that determine his unique adjustments to his environment.
- determined by: biological(hereditary, brain, physical), cultural, familial and social factors.
- The big Five Model of personality.(Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.(Extroverted vs Introverted, sensing vs intuition, thinking vs feeling, judging vs perceiving).

## Motivation:
derived form 'Movere', to move, a complex interactions of behaviors, needs, rewards, reinforcements and cognitive activities.

- need approaches:
1. Maslow: Physiological, safety, social, esteem and actualization.
2. Fedrick Herzberg: job context: hygiene factors, motivators.
3. ERG: experience, relatedness and growth.
4. theory of needs; achievement, affiliation an power.

- Cognitive approaches:
 Equity.
 Expectancy: Expectancy, Instrumentatiliy, valence
 Goal setting.

- Reinforcement:
(positive, negative reinforcements & extinctions and punishments)


- Social learning theory:(Albert Banduras: Vicarious learning, arousal, enactive, verbal persuasion)

---
## Groups:
- forming, storming, norming, performing, adjourning.
