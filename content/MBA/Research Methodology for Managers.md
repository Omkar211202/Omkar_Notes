- observation.

1. Descriptive: describe behaviors, characteristics and trends.
- surveys and questionaries.
- case studies
- observational studies.

1. Casual Research  Design: (Explanatory Research)
2. Experimental Research
3. Longitudinal research design
4. cross sectional design
5. Qualitative
6. Quantitative
7. Mixed.

Specs of Research questions: SMART.
