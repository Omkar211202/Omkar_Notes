## The Case:

This is a case about Mr. X, who is running a company doing Car Sales, Spares, Service and Safety. It consists of 50 employees across the above 4 divisions.

He is running a single  Showroom, till some time in the recent past, however he got an opportunity to set up an additional showroom in another area.

This is because his past record impressed the car manufacturer, who asked him to expand.
The Car manufacturer also produces, scooters and asked him to set up a showroom for scooters alone, which resulted in Mr. X expanding into another showroom.

He starts off the scooter showroom, and employs his star performing sales employees to work in the scooter showroom. The star performing employees are reluctant due to travel and other concerns they had to work there.

Mr. X did this because he was not able to hire good sales employees in a short period notice.

However, Mr. X in the process of finds some problems during the entire process:
- Hiring has become a more timely and ineffective process done solely by him.
- The conversion rates are very less.
- The younger hires are very interested, know the trends in the market and tech savvy, but will move out faster if given jobs by others. They also spend more time on phones.
- The experience workers are mostly residents of the region and have to look after the family alone. They however do not have updates of trends and are not tech savvy.

Suggest some advice to solve the above problems:
