## Writing an Abstract
- summarize the key elements of the entire paper
- should cover study's objectives, methodologies and mind findings and conclusions, up to  150-250 words. (Word limit is depending on the journal)
- brief about the research problem.
- write about the methodologies.
- significant results, relevance of your work and impact.
- key-words: correctly used, means more audience will visit the paper.


> [!Question] Question
> Should you write the abstract in the beginning or end of the paper?
> Depends on your situation. If your journal may want a pre-entry then its important to have an abstract before completion, else you may write it at the end since, it will summarize the entire article. 

How is introduction different from abstract?
- Introduction gives a detailed view of the paper, tells the value of the paper, talks about the proposition, can go up to 2 pages.
- Abstract is more comprehensive and will cover conclusions, methods and results, unlike an introduction.

## Introduction:
- should be written in the past generally, must tell about the topic, questions and significance of the study (Value or Impact).
- provokes reader's interest, start broader and narrow to the research question.
- Value is created here, laying foundation and expectations of the reader.

## Literature Review:
- connects or binds your paper to the existing scholarship.
- look for academic databases and search engines to identify key publications.
- identify the themes, trends and gaps in the research address.
- Should be argumentative and expose some knowledge gaps and contradictions.

- use more numbers to gain more validation.

## Discussion:
- analysis and explanation of the research questions and findings.
- implications of the paper into practice.
- propose avenues for future work.

- should encapsulate the main findings of the research and reiterate the significance of the findings and paper.
