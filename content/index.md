## Welcome to Black-Box...

Well, if you don't feel like reading, try out these: #Podcast
  
Lets start off with a Riddle:

Who am I?
Anything Ordinary diminishes on being used or spent and grows when accumulated or saved. But I am Unique. I grow when I am spent or used, but diminish or perish when kept in silence or hoarded.
There may be none like me.... I am Unique Who am I?

Well, the sole aim of this Black Box is to make me thrive. Remember, I thrive when spent time on. Some minute fragments of me include:

- #MBA : Aspects of Finance, Marketing, Analytics and Operations.
- #Actuarial : Covers Exam FM.
- #Research : Starting a research, doing a research project etc.
- #Techie : AI and Web development.

Well, I Surpass the oceans in my depth, Mountains height, I take mankind from steps to leaps.

I thrive when you share, So share, visit and revisit.

WHO AM I?
